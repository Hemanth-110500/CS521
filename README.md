# Investigating Bias and Memorization in Language Models: An Analysis Across Diverse Question-Answer Datasets

### Description:
This project explores bias and memorization phenomena in language models (LMs) using various question-answer datasets. We analyze how LMs respond to different types of questions, considering factors such as wording variations, demographic references, question structures and jumbling options. The analysis aims to provide insights into the behavior of LMs regarding bias, fairness, and memorization across diverse datasets.
